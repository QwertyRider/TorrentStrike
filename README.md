Upload all files to your website.


-2- Additional setup: Creating missing files and CHMOD them (only needed by restricted apache server)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-3- Setting up Torrentstrike:
----------------------

open your web browser to http://www.yourdomain.com/admincp.php
Enter all the needed info there and submit.
Keep the 'Activate PhpBB Forum' box unchecked for now !

After saving your config, the install will install the needed sql files for you.


-4- Create a Torrentstrike sysop account:
--------------------------------

open your web browser to http://www.yourdomain.com and choose Register
Register your account. 
This first created account will be granted with Sysop administrative rights, so it's good to choose 'admin' as 'Desired username'.


-5- Installing phpbb:
--------------------

Click the forum link, and choose "INSTALL NOW !" (This link is only shown if you are the sysop)
All parameters are set for you by TorrentStrike (check if they are correct for you), you only need to reenter your sysop account password.
Click the 'finish installation' button.

-6- Activate phpbb:
-------------------

open your web browser to http://www.yourdomain.com/admincp.php
check the 'Activate PhpBB Forum' box and submit.
delete install/ and contrib/ directories from the phpbb2 folder.
Logout and then Login again from the sysop account to update the phpbb admin login. (do it ,it's important!)

-7- Configure phpbb:
-------------------

use the link 'Go to Administration Panel' inside each phpbb page, you will need to identify yourself again


####################################
    UPGRADING FROM V0.3 TO V0.4
####################################

DON'T FORGET TO BACKUP YOUR DATABASE AND WEBSITE FILES BEFORE UPGRADING !


-1- Set your TorrentStrike V0.3 Offline:
----------------------------------------

open your web browser to http://www.yourdomain.com/admincp.php
Uncheck the "Site Online" box and save your config

-2- Upload TorrentStrike V0.4 files:
------------------------------------

Upload all the V0.4 file to your old TorrentStrike, there is 2 ways to do this:
- You can simply overwrite all old files with V0.4 files.
- You can delete all files from your V0.3 install, except include/config.php and phpBB2/config.php, then upload all V0.4 files.


-3- Update TorrentStrike config:
-------------------------------

open your web browser to http://www.yourdomain.com/admincp.php
The upgrade step will ask you to: 
1 - upgrade your database
2 - run the phpbb upgrade script (if you're not using phpbb it's not necessary)
3 - Return to admincp and check back the Site Online box and save your new config by submitting your changes!



#######################
   ADDITIONNAL NOTE
#######################

Autocleanup is now active again, but accounts are never deleted (This is because of a bug with phpbb account cleaning)
You can use the Full Cleanup function in the Admin/mods Control Panel to perform a manual full cleanup (including account removal) when you want !

You want to upgrade with a modified version of TorrentStrike V0.3:
------------------------------------------------------------------
We can't certify the upgrade will work, but one thing is sure: You will lose your personal add-ons.
You can use a tool like winmerge (http://winmerge.sourceforge.net) to diff V0.3 original files with your modified V0.3 files,
and keep trace of what you need to report in the new V0.4 files after upgrading.

If you need support for this king of problem, be careful: 
Half of the users patch the code everywhere and simply don't know what they're doing !
We have no mercy for them: So double check what you're doing before asking for help...
